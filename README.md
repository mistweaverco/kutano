# Kutano

Kutano aims to be a dead-simple OSS 🐧 that can a be a replacement for calendly 📅.
It should be easily pluggable in existing Wordpress 📚 installations,
or be used as stand-alone-application ⚡.

Kutano is [swahili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swahili_language) and means calendar.

# Why?

- Calendly is awesome, but it costs money to be really awesome.
- PHP is not the cool kid on the block anymore, but most cheap hosters come with PHP support.
- SvelteKit is probably the cool kid on the block, but is also really easy to learn and use.
  - it also has a static adapter, which makes it really easy to deploy on a simple webspace pack.
- Nx is a great tool to manage monorepos, and as we are using vastly different stacks, it makes sense to use it.
